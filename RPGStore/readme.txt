First, you must double click on the program labeled "RPGStore.exe"
Once opened for the first time, a short monologue will be printed out within the command window.
To progress through the dialoge you must press a key on your keyboard. It isn't specific on which key you press, but it will wait on any key to be pressed to continue. 
The opening monologue is skipped if a proper save file is present.
After the beginning monologue ends, the program will then begin to ask you for some specified inputs correlating to their action "(Buy Item/Sell Item/View Inventory/Exit Shop)" 
You can either type out the whole phrase or you can use "Buy", "Sell", "Inventory", or "Exit" respectively. 
The commands are not case sensitive, but they must be spelled correctly in order for the program to recognize it. Press enter for the program to recognize the input

Buying items
	If you chose to buy an item, the shop's inventory will be listed out to you. You can then type out the name of your desired item to select it for purchase. 
	Much like the main menu commands, it is not case sensitive but it is spelling sensitive.
	Once an item is selected, it displays all information about that item and will ask you if you want to buy it or not. It is a "Yes" or "No" input.
	If you typed yes, the item will be purchased for the cost described and the item will be moved into your inventory, and it will return to the main menu.
	If you typed yes and do NOT have enough money to purchase the item, or if you typed no, the item will not be purchased.

Selling items
	If you chose to buy an item, your inventory will be shown to you. You can then select the item from your inventory you want to sell.
	The program will then ask if you want to sell it for an amount less than that of the normal buying price. This is a Yes or No input.
	If answered yes, you will receive the amount of money the item sells for and the item will be moved to the shop's inventory.
	If answered no, then the program will go back to the main menu without any item being sold
	If there is nothing in your inventory, then you are told that you have nothing and the program will take you to the main menu
